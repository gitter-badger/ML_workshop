October 8

## Program

Main organizer: MS, assisting: JZ

Saturday workshop is all about reinforcement learning (RL).
 
There will be competition amongst the participants to create the best algorithm for a given task, with a small award :-) 

### What is reinforcement learning?

Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning inspired by behaviorist psychology, concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. 

In machine learning, the environment is typically formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) as many reinforcement learning algorithms for this context utilize dynamic programming techniques.
 
Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning technique. Specifically, Q-learning can be used to find an optimal action-selection policy for any given (finite) Markov decision process (MDP)

A recent application of Q-learning to deep learning, by Google DeepMind, titled "deep reinforcement learning" or "deep Q-networks", has been successful at playing some Atari 2600 games at expert human levels.

Take a look at this two-minute-paper which nicely summarizes recent publications:

Deep reinforcement learning has very interesting real-world applications. In July, 2016, [DeepMind announced](https://deepmind.com/blog) they reduced google data center electricity cooling bill by 40%, which is a huge saving on costs and the environment.


### Workshop details
We will go through necessary theory and basics in the morning. In the afternoon we will focus on solving problems from OpenAI Gym and train RL models on GPUs.

### Timetable:

| Time            | Activity               |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| 9:00 - 10:30    | Basics with TensorFlow 
| 10:30 - 12:00   | Theory for RL
| *12:00 - 13:00* | *Lunch break* 
| 13:00 - 16:30   | Tutorials
| *16:30 - 17:00* | *Coffee break*
| 17:00 - 20:00   | Competition coding
| 20:00 - 21:00   | Finalizing the day
| 20:00 - 09:00   | Running models all night long

### Competition
Details about the competition are to be be specified.

## Place

FIT OI, room 350

## Necessary prerequisites for participants

For the workshop to run effectively, participants should:

- be proficient at programing in Python
- have taken courses on probability & statistics, linear algebra and mathematical analysis

It is a plus if you had taken a course in Optimization/Biologically inspired algorithms/Planning
  
If you don't know python, please learn some basics - there's a lot materials available online and it is quite a simple language.
